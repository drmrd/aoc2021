    "<h2>--- Day 13: Transparent Origami ---</h2><p>You reach another volcanically active part of the cave. It would be nice if you could do some kind of thermal imaging so you could tell ahead of time which caves are too hot to safely enter.</p>\n",
    "<p>Fortunately, the submarine seems to be equipped with a thermal camera! When you activate it, you are greeted with:</p>\n",

    "</code></pre>\n",
    "<p>Apparently, the Elves have never used this feature. To your surprise, you manage to find the manual; as you go to open it, page 1 falls out. It's a large sheet of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transparency_(projection)\" target=\"_blank\">transparent paper</a>! The transparent paper is marked with random dots and includes instructions on how to fold it up (your puzzle input). For example:</p>\n",

    "<p>The first section is a list of dots on the transparent paper. <code>0,0</code> represents the top-left coordinate.  The first value, <code>x</code>, increases to the right.  The second value, <code>y</code>, increases downward.  So, the coordinate <code>3,0</code> is to the right of <code>0,0</code>, and the coordinate <code>0,7</code> is below <code>0,0</code>. The coordinates in this example form the following pattern, where <code>#</code> is a dot on the paper and <code>.</code> is an empty, unmarked position:</p>\n",

    "<p>Then, there is a list of <em>fold instructions</em>. Each instruction indicates a line on the transparent paper and wants you to fold the paper <em>up</em> (for horizontal <code>y=...</code> lines) or <em>left</em> (for vertical <code>x=...</code> lines). In this example, the first fold instruction is <code>fold along y=7</code>, which designates the line formed by all of the positions where <code>y</code> is <code>7</code> (marked here with <code>-</code>):</p>\n",

    "<p>Also notice that some dots can end up <em>overlapping</em>; in this case, the dots merge together and become a single dot.</p>\n",
    "<p>The second fold instruction is <code>fold along x=5</code>, which indicates this line:</p>\n",
