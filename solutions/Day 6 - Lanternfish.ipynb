    "<h2>--- Day 6: Lanternfish ---</h2><p>The sea floor is getting steeper. Maybe the sleigh keys got carried this way?</p>\n",
    "<p>A massive school of glowing <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lanternfish\" target=\"_blank\">lanternfish</a> swims past. They must spawn quickly to reach such large numbers - maybe <em>exponentially</em> quickly? You should model their growth rate to be sure.</p>\n",
    "<p>Although you know nothing about this specific species of lanternfish, you make some guesses about their attributes. Surely, <span title=\"I heard you like lanternfish.\">each lanternfish creates a new lanternfish</span> once every <em>7</em> days.</p>\n",
    "<p>However, this process isn't necessarily synchronized between every lanternfish - one lanternfish might have 2 days left until it creates another lanternfish, while another might have 4. So, you can model each fish as a single number that represents <em>the number of days until it creates a new lanternfish</em>.</p>\n",
    "<p>Furthermore, you reason, a <em>new</em> lanternfish would surely need slightly longer before it's capable of producing more lanternfish: two more days for its first cycle.</p>\n",
    "<p>So, suppose you have a lanternfish with an internal timer value of <code>3</code>:</p>\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li>After one day, its internal timer would become <code>2</code>.</li>\n",
    "<li>After another day, its internal timer would become <code>1</code>.</li>\n",
    "<li>After another day, its internal timer would become <code>0</code>.</li>\n",
    "<li>After another day, its internal timer would reset to <code>6</code>, and it would create a <em>new</em> lanternfish with an internal timer of <code>8</code>.</li>\n",
    "<li>After another day, the first lanternfish would have an internal timer of <code>5</code>, and the second lanternfish would have an internal timer of <code>7</code>.</li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "<p>A lanternfish that creates a new fish resets its timer to <code>6</code>, <em>not <code>7</code></em> (because <code>0</code> is included as a valid timer value). The new lanternfish starts with an internal timer of <code>8</code> and does not start counting down until the next day.</p>\n",
    "<p>Realizing what you're trying to do, the submarine automatically produces a list of the ages of several hundred nearby lanternfish (your puzzle input). For example, suppose you were given the following list:</p>\n",
    "<pre><code>3,4,3,1,2</code></pre>\n",
    "<p>This list means that the first fish has an internal timer of <code>3</code>, the second fish has an internal timer of <code>4</code>, and so on until the fifth fish, which has an internal timer of <code>2</code>. Simulating these fish over several days would proceed as follows:</p>\n",
